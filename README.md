# Motivation
Sensing signals are able to be utilized for low-cost data transfer in resource-contained devices. Optical communication using CommercialOff-The-Shelf (COTS) optical sensors (e.g. leds) have low sampling rates in contrast to specialized hardware with customized front-ends and high sampling rates. Recent works have made progress in establishing a Visible Light Communication channel between devices, but they use customized front-ends with high sampling rates at the receiver.

# Design Goals
Embed data in optical signals and optimize signal demodulation and decoding at the receiver
